Microsoft Windows This is a quick overview of the installation process. Full installation instructions are in the file setup_readme.htm included in the install package windows_64_<version>_unicode.zip which can be downloaded from the Dyalog website . For more information about installed components, registry entries and configuration etc. see the Dyalog for Microsoft Windows Installation and Configuration Guide . Go to the download page and download the installation package windows_64_<version>_unicode.zip . Unzip the installation package and double click on setup.exe . Restart the installer with administrator privileges . Choose your APL keyboard. The default APL keyboard uses Ctrl as the APL shifting key. It does not prevent copy and paste shortcuts, but some prefer to use a different method. Note (May 2022) If you are using Microsoft Windows 11, then you might find that the standard Dyalog IME does not work with UWP (Universal Windows Platform) applications such as Notepad.

Microsoft Windows If you select \"Install the Dyalog APL IME for 64 bit Windows\" during installation , you will have an additional keyboard input method with the ability to type APL symbols by holding the Ctrl key. In Windows 10, you can use \u229e Win + Space to choose between available keyboard layouts. Note (May 2022) If you are using Microsoft Windows 11, then you might find that the standard Dyalog IME does not work with UWP (Universal Windows Platform) applications such as Notepad. We are working on both immediate and long-term solutions to meet our customers' wide range of needs. By default, Dyalog's Input Method Editor (IME) uses Ctrl to enter APL symbols. If you would like an alternative input method, such as using the AltGr shifting key or backtick ` prefix similar to tryapl , see section 2.2.5 of Mastering Dyalog APL . Linux (including Raspberry Pi) and macOS See the APL Wiki page about Typing Glyphs on Linux . macOS Note When installing Dyalog for macOS, the font and keyboard mappings are automatically installed and enabled for use in a Dyalog Session \u2013 the following allows use of Dyalog glyphs both outside and inside a Dyalog Session (for example, in email). To enable these keyboard key mappings on macOS, the appropriate DyalogAlt.keylayout and DyalogAlt.icns files for your locale must be downloaded and installed in the /Library/Keyboard Layouts directory. To download a zip file containing these files, click on the relevant flag (if the country you require is not shown, then please e-mail us and we'll see whether we can create the relevant files for you): alt shifting key: While alt is held, pressing another key may produce an APL glyph. For example, alt + a makes \u237a . Danish Finnish Italian Prefix keys Press the specified key followed by another key to produce an APL glyph. For example, \u00a7 then a makes \u237a on DyalogSection layouts. See the APL Wiki section about Typing Glyphs on macOS . Keyboard layouts and fonts for macOS are described on the dfns website . Troubleshooting Cannot type APL symbols in RIDE on Linux RIDE is not yet compatible with the APL keyboard system on Wayland. However, it has its own mechanism for typing APL symbols using the prefix method. One workaround is to start GNOME in X11 mode instead of Wayland. The XCompose-based prefix keyboard will work in RIDE on Wayland.
