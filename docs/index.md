## Core Documentation

### [Dyalog APL Language Reference Guide](https://docs.dyalog.com/latest/Dyalog%20APL%20Language%20Reference%20Guide.pdf)
This document details the individual elements that form the 'vocabulary' of the APL language. It explains every primitive function, primitive operator, system function, system variable, system command and error message in Dyalog.

It is assumed that the reader has a reasonable understanding of both mathematics and Dyalog.

### [Dyalog Programming Reference Guide](https://docs.dyalog.com/latest/Dyalog%20Programming%20Reference%20Guide.pdf)
This document details the syntax that forms the 'grammar' of the APL language. It describes the viable values that can be used in expressions and explains how the individual language elements can be manipulated through defined functions and operators, control structures and object oriented programming, as well as the way in which multi-threading can be implemented.

It is assumed that the reader has a reasonable understanding of both mathematics and Dyalog.

### [.NET Core Interface Guide](https://docs.dyalog.com/latest/dotNET%20Core%20Interface%20Guide.pdf)
!!!Note
	Dyalog Unicode edition only

This document describes the Dyalog interface to Microsoft .NET Core, the cross-platform (Windows, Linux and macOS) successor to Microsoft's .NET Framework. It does not attempt to explain the features of .NET Core, except in terms of their APL interfaces.

It is assumed that the reader has a working knowledge of Dyalog, familiarity with .NET Core and/or .NET Framework and a basic understanding of OO methodologies.

#### [Comparison of .NET Core/Framework Interfaces](https://docs.dyalog.com/latest/dotNET%20Differences.pdf)

## Microsoft Windows-Specific Documentation
These documents are specific to running Dyalog on the Microsoft Windows operating system.

### [Dyalog for Microsoft Windows Installation and Configuration Guide](https://docs.dyalog.com/latest/Dyalog%20for%20Microsoft%20Windows%20Installation%20and%20Configuration%20Guide.pdf)
This document covers the installation procedure and configuration options for Dyalog on the Microsoft Windows operating system. It details the parameters that can be used to customise individual instances, the creation of executables and run-time applications, use of the command line and the Dyalog Dynamic Link Library, as well as describing the recovery process if a system error is encountered.

It is assumed that the reader has a basic knowledge of Microsoft Windows and software terminology; a working knowledge of Dyalog is useful but not essential.
