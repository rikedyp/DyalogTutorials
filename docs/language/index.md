# Getting started with APL
You do not need to install anything to get started using and learning the APL language. It is possible to get started with the materials listed here using the [TryAPL online interpreter](https://tryapl.org). 

If you are already familiar with a programming language or two, [the book **Learning APL** by Stefan Kruger](https://xpqz.github.io/learnapl) offers an excellent introduction to modern APL for experienced programmers.

The book [Mastering Dyalog APL by Bernard Legrand](https://mastering.dyalog.com) is aimed at new developers and is suitable for people with no prior programming experience. However, it is also a fairly comprehensive guide to the many aspects of both the APL language and the Dyalog development environments, and so intermediate and advanced users will still find it invaluable.

The book was originally published in 2009, and although it is being re-worked as an e-book to include chapters on recent features, the original is still [available as a physical book](https://www.dyalog.com/mastering-dyalog-apl.htm).

Below we offer a bare-bones introduction with some simple examples to give you a sense of what the language can look like.
